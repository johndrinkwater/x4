This is the current todo list. Feel free to contribute.


CORE:

1) Flexible Config Parser
  It has been decided that the config parser will be able to read the same format as Nefarious2
  to keep it standardized and simple, with one little change.

  The config parser will support the following:
    Method A (single line): Block { key = "value"; }
    Method B (multi-line):
      Block {
       key = "value"
      }

  The semicolon will be optional while using a long format syntax and is NOT required for the
  final block close. It should however support it incase someone adds it!

  The config parser needs to support all common comment types:
    // Type one
    /* Type two */
    # Type three

  It needs to support non-case sensitive block names and key names. But values must be case
  sensitive.


2) Module Subsystem
3) Logging Subsystem
4) Event Engine
5) IO Loop Engine (ties into the Event Engine)
6) Database Subsystem
