  To keep our coding clean, we ask that anyone who contributes code to please keep it within the
  following parameters to ensure it looks like it was done with one hand. It makes it a lot
  easier when working on code with large groups of people for easy understanding.


  ~ Clean Code ~

  Indentation:
    All indents should be spaced as 4. Not with tab (unless tab is set to equal 4 spaces)
    For sanity purposes, the maximum amount of indented variables within a single opening
    direction is ADVISED as 8. If exceeding 8 opening indents, it is highly recommended
    to create a second function and call it.

  Comments:
    Please remember to always place comments where needed. Using proper C style comments, not
    C++ or some varying slang mess.

      /*
       * This is an ACCEPTABLE multiline comment.
       */

      /* This is an ACCEPTABLE singleline comment. */

  Variable Spacing:
    ACCEPTABLE: Var1, Var2, Var3, Var4
    NON-ACCEPTABLE: Var1,Var2,Var3,Var4
    NON-ACCEPTABLE: Var1 , Var2 , Var3 , Var4

    * Please use proper spacing.

  Variable Definitions:
    ACCEPTABLE: Var = something
    NON-ACCEPTABLE: Var=something


  Variable Names:
    Names should be simple, and relevant to the function of it's purpose. You should not be
    naming a ChanServ module with funky/unrelated names that will cause the end-user
    confusion while trying to modify the code. Remember, it is open source!

  Line length:
    Long lines should not exceed 72 characters under general conditions. Lines that are longer
    should be continued on a second line and wrapped (including indent).

  Opening Brackets:
    Opening brackets should always be on a new line.
    Example:
      void function()
      {
          ...
      }
